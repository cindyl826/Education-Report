## Intension
This is a kaggle competition where data were provided for edX online courses. We needed to build models to predict student's completion of the courses. Three classidiers were chosen to train models and we picked out the best model to predict result.  
## The selected 3 Classifiers
### Decision Tree
Supervised Learning algorithms
a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. 
### Random Forest
Supervised Learning algorithms


### K-Nearest

# Education-Report
## Intension
This is a kaggle competition where data were provided for edX online courses. We needed to build models to predict student's completion of the courses. Three classifiers were chosen to train models and we picked out the best model to predict result.  
## The selected 3 Classifiers
### Decision Tree
Supervised Learning algorithms
a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. 
### Random Forest
Supervised Learning algorithms
The Random Forest classifier consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our modelâ€™s prediction 
### K-Nearest
Supervised Learning algorithms
The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN,uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
